DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  MICHIGAN DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN
THE PROGRAM WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT OPERATION WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. MICHIGAN shall not be liable for special, indirect,
incidental, or consequential damages with respect to any claim on account of or
arising from this Agreement or use of the PROGRAM, even if MICHIGAN has been or
is hereafter advised of the possibility of such damages. Because some states do
not allow certain exclusions or limitations on implied warranties or of
liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above exclusions may not
apply to LICENSEE. In no event, however, will MICHIGAN be liable to LICENSEE,
under any theory of recovery, in an amount in excess of the license fee  paid by
LICENSEE under this Agreement.
